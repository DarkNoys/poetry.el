* Poetry.el

 [[https://poetry.eustace.io/][Poetry]] (python packaging and dependency management) in Emacs.


** Installation

   1. Install dependencies

      Poetry.el needs ~transient~ and ~pyvenv~ to be installed.
      All those packages are available on MELPA.

   2. Clone the ~poetry.el~ repository:

      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/galaunay/poetry.el /path/to/poetry.el/directory
      #+END_SRC

   3. Add the following lines to ~.emacs.el~ (or equivalent):

      #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/poetry.el/directory")
      (require 'poetry)
      #+END_SRC


** Usage

Poetry.el uses [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] to provide a magit-like interface.
The entry point is simply:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x poetry
#+END_SRC
The interface should then be pretty much self-explanatory for poetry users:

#+attr_html: :width 400px

*** Tracking Poetry virtualenv
~Poetry.el~ also provides a global minor mode that automatically activates the associated virtualenv when visiting a poetry project.
You can activate this feature with
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x poetry-tracking-mode
#+END_SRC
