** Poetry.el

 [[https://poetry.eustace.io/][Poetry]] in Emacs.

 This is a work in progress, advices are welcome.


** Usage

Poetry.el uses [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] to provide a magit-like interface.
The entry point is simply:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x poetry
#+END_SRC
The interface should then be pretty much self-explanatory:

** Installation

   1. Install dependencies
   
      Poetry.el needs ~transient~ and ~xterm-color~ to be installed.
      They are both available on MELPA. 
      
   2. Clone the ~poetry.el~ repository:
   
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/galaunay/poetry.el /path/to/poetry.el/directory
      #+END_SRC
      
   3. Add the following lines to ~.emacs.el~ (or equivalent):
   
      #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/poetry.el/directory")
      (require 'poetry)
      #+END_SRC
